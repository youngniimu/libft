# libft
School project for Hive Helsinki.

One of the first assignments was to build our own library for C language. Without few exceptions this was the only library we were allowed to use in our later assignments. By this we truly had to understand the usage and meaning of the functions we were using and also the importance of expanding the library as we went with other useful functions.
